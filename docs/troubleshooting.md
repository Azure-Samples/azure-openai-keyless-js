## Troubleshooting

Here are the most common failure scenarios and solutions:

1. The subscription (`AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`) doesn't have access to the Azure OpenAI service. Please ensure `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` matches the ID specified in the [OpenAI access request process](https://aka.ms/oai/access).

1. You're attempting to create resources in regions not enabled for Azure OpenAI (e.g. East US 2 instead of East US), or where the model you're trying to use isn't enabled. See [this matrix of model availability](https://aka.ms/oai/models).

1. You've exceeded a quota, most often number of resources per region. See [this article on quotas and limits](https://aka.ms/oai/quotas). If this happens, you have a few options:

   - Delete other unused resources in the region you're trying to deploy to.
   - Deploy to a different region.
   - Try to use a different model (see `main.parameters.json`) or adjust the capacity in `infra/main.bicep`.
   - Request a quota increase.

1. You're getting "same resource name not allowed" conflicts. That's likely because you've run the sample multiple times and deleted the resources you've been creating each time, but are forgetting to purge them. Azure keeps resources for 48 hours unless you purge from soft delete. See [this article on purging resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/recover-purge-resources?tabs=azure-portal#purge-a-deleted-resource).
